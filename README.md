# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The Coloado Board of Elections provided the election results of a recent local congressional election in a CSV format.  This projects is to review and summarize the election results to be published.  There were two steps to the analysis.  The first was during the project where we analyzed the candidates and their vote results.  The second was covered in the challenge which focused on summarizing county results (see below Challenge section for further information).  The output from this review summarizes the election results by providing the following data points:
 - total votes collected 
 - the candidates 
 - each candidates individual results (total votes and % of votes)
 - the final winner of the election

## Resources
 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 - Software: Python 3.6.1 Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election data shows that:
 - 369,711 votes were cast
 - There were three candidate with the following results
   - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes
   - Diana DeGette: 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes
   - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of the votes with 11,606 votes
 - The winner of the election was
    - Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes or 73.8% of all votes

The challenge requested additional information regarding the prior election analysis.  The primary purpose of the challenge was to add county results, specifically the count of votes by county and to identify the county with the largest number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary
I would recommend utilizing the code created for this analysis in other elections like this one.  In addition with some small modifications this could be used for other elections.  This would save time and potential errors but utilizing this code as a starting basis and modifying as needed.  For example
